# smallsh
A small shell I devolped in just under 2 weeks (10/25/2022 - 11/7/2022) for project 3 in my Operating Systems class.

Some of the requirements for this project were:

1.) Provide a prompt for running commands

2.) Handle blank lines and comments, which are lines beginning with the # character

3.) Provide expansion for the variable $$

4.) Execute 3 commands exit, cd, and status via code built into the shell

5.) Execute other commands by creating new processes using a function from the exec family of functions

6.) Support input and output redirection

7.) Support running commands in foreground and background processes

8.) Implement custom handlers for 2 signals, SIGINT and SIGTSTP
